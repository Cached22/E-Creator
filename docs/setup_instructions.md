# Email Account Creation App - Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up the Email Account Creation App, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git (Version control system)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and clone the project repository using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/email-account-creation-app.git
   cd email-account-creation-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment to manage the project's dependencies:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to include your specific configuration settings.

6. **Initialize the Database (Optional)**

   If the application uses a database, set it up at this point. Instructions would be specific to the database being used.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**

   Run the `main.py` script to start the application:

   ```
   python email_creator/main.py
   ```

2. **Access the User Interface**

   - If a command-line interface (CLI) is provided, follow the on-screen prompts.
   - If a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided, the application window will open.

## Testing the Application

1. **Run Automated Tests**

   Execute the test suite to verify that the setup is correct and the application is functioning as expected:

   ```
   pytest
   ```

## Additional Configuration

- Review the `config.py` file to adjust any additional settings such as `MAX_RETRIES`, `USER_AGENT`, or `PROXY_LIST`.
- Customize the `logger.py` settings if you need different logging levels or formats.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all commands are run within the activated virtual environment.
- Check the Python version with `python --version` to confirm compatibility.
- Review error messages in the terminal for clues on what might be wrong.
- Consult the `README.md` and `docs/usage_instructions.md` for further guidance.

## Conclusion

After following these setup instructions, your Email Account Creation App should be ready for use and development. For contributing to the project, please refer to `docs/contribution_guidelines.md`.
