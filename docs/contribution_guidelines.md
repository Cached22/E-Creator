# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the Email Account Creation App project! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our application. This document outlines the process for contributing to the project and the standards we expect contributors to follow.

## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please ensure you have:

- Forked the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Cloned your fork to your local machine.
- Set up the Python virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv` and activating it.
- Installed the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to Contribute

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for open issues that you are interested in working on. If you have a new idea or find a bug, please open a new issue for discussion.

2. **Discuss**: Comment on the issue to express your interest and discuss your approach. This helps avoid multiple people working on the same issue without coordination.

3. **Branch**: Create a new branch from the `main` branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature/add-proxy-support` or `bugfix/login-issue`.

4. **Code**: Develop your feature or fix on your branch. Make sure to follow the coding standards and use the shared dependencies and names as specified in the project documentation.

5. **Commit**: Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the changes you have made. Reference the issue number in your commit messages if applicable.

6. **Test**: Add and run tests for your changes. Ensure that all tests pass and that your code does not break existing functionality.

7. **Document**: Update the `README.md`, `setup_instructions.md`, and `usage_instructions.md` if your changes require it. Make sure to document any new dependencies or environment variables.

8. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository. Describe your changes and link to the issue you are addressing.

9. **Review**: Wait for the project maintainers to review your pull request. Be open to feedback and make any requested changes.

10. **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main branch.

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
- Include comments and docstrings to explain complex logic or decisions.
- Keep functions and classes small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Avoid hard-coding values; use constants and configuration files instead.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Screenshots or error messages if applicable.
- Any relevant code snippets or logs.

## Code Review

All contributions will undergo a code review by the project maintainers. The review will focus on code quality, functionality, and alignment with the project's goals. Please be patient and responsive during the review process.

## Community

We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive community. Please be respectful and considerate in your interactions with other contributors.
