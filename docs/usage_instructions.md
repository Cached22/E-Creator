# Usage Instructions for Email Account Creation App

## Getting Started

Before you can start using the Email Account Creation App, make sure you have Python installed on your system and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To configure the application, edit the `email_creator/config.py` file with the necessary details such as `BASE_URL`, `USER_AGENT`, `MAX_RETRIES`, and `PROXY_LIST`. You can also set up your environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required information.

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the project's root directory and execute:

```
python -m email_creator.main
```

This will start the process of creating email accounts based on the configurations you've set.

## Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

If you have implemented a CLI, you can use the following command to interact with the application:

```
python -m ui.cli
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to create email accounts.

## Using the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

If a GUI is available, start it by running:

```
python -m ui.gui
```

The GUI will guide you through the process of creating email accounts.

## Monitoring Progress

The application logs events and errors during the account creation process. Check the logs by opening the file generated by `email_creator/logger.py` to monitor the progress.

## Saving Account Details

The created account details are saved automatically by the `save_account_details()` function. You can find the saved accounts in the specified output file or database as configured in `email_creator/config.py`.

## Handling Errors

The application is designed to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs, it will attempt to retry the account creation process up to `MAX_RETRIES` times. You can review the error logs for more details on any issues encountered.

## Testing

To ensure the application is working correctly, you can run the test suite located in the `tests/` directory:

```
pytest
```

Make sure all tests pass before using the application to create bulk email accounts.
